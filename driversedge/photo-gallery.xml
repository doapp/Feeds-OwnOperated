          <media:description>Anyone who grew up on dog-eared copies of Popular Science probably assumed we’d be riding around in self-driving cars while viewing the passing scenery through glass or plastic bubble roofs.

          <media:description>Now, here’s the Genesis Essentia, an all-electric performance concept with a transparent hood and a fully retro-futuristic bubble roof.

          <media:description>And it has all the fanciful hallmarks of a concept befitting the luxury branding: super-lightweight, low-slung, carbon-fiber monocoque body; butterfly doors that are opened with a fingerprint sensor or biometric facial recognition; and a battery-powered motor that Genesis says can sprint to 60 mph in three seconds.

      <description>It’s here – the all-new Honda Insight. Following the debut of the prototype in Detroit, Honda is finally showing off its handsome new hybrid in the sheet metal. Scheduled for an official showing at the New York Auto Show in just a few days, Honda’s latest entry into its growing fleet of electrified vehicles is also one of its most advanced.

          <media:description>Borrowing a number of design cues from the rest of the Honda range, including the "flying wing" grille, the low-profile LED headlights and taillights, and the coupe-like roofline, the Insight will be positioned (and priced) between the smaller Civic and the larger Accord.

          <media:description>An efficient two-motor hybrid powertrain, similar to the one found on the Accord Hybrid, comes under the hood. A 1.5-liter gas engine paired to an electric propulsion motor and a lithium ion battery pack delivers 151 horsepower (112 kilowatts) and 197 pound-feet (267 Newton-meters) of torque.

          <media:description>"The Honda Insight shows consumers that the efficiency of a hybrid car doesn't mean sacrificing style, refinement or performance," said Henio Arcangeli, Jr., senior vice president of American Honda Motor Co., Inc. "The Insight is another symbol of a new era in the evolution of Honda electrified vehicles, where customers can have everything they want with no compromises."

      <description>The droopy derrière that made the first A7 Sportback stand out among other Audis is now a thing of the past as the new generation comes with a completely reworked rear end.

          <media:description>The A6’s more athletic cousin embraces the company’s new design language that started with the flagship A8 with which it shares many of the styling cues, but with an emphasis on a more dynamic shape to put the sport in Sportback.

          <media:description>Motor1.com friend Auditography had the privilege of being the first to immortalize the A7 following the model’s official debut back in the second half of October 2017. The subject of his photo shoot conducted in Oslo, Norway at freezing temperatures of -13 degrees Celsius (8.6 degrees Fahrenheit) was an elegant black example in the 55 TFSI Quattro flavor as per Audi’s new controversial nomenclature.

          <media:description>Going up against the all-new Mercedes CLS and the aging BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe, the A7 bets on being a technological tour de force wrapped in a sleek body to lure in customers looking for a four-door model with a practical tailgate.

          <media:description>It has just about the same bells and whistles as the A8 (and the new A6 Sedan), including Audi’s new approach towards the user interface with dual touchscreen displays dominating the center console and complementing the second-generation of the “Virtual Cockpit.”

          <media:description>It’s a looker isn’t it? Unlike dominant German rivals, the V60 ditches sharp creases in favor of
flowing lines and generally more sculpted physique. Volvo’s signature Thor hammerhead headlights make a return on
this wagon, as does a broad chromed grille. Overall the car presents a sophisticated and elegant alternative to SUV
alternatives.

          <media:description>Inside you’ll find a cabin that won’t be mistaken for an Audi or BMW. A minimalist design
            comes curtesy of a large portrait touchscreen that has absorbed most of the switchgear. Air conditioning,
            navigation, media, it’s all housed in this 9.0-inch display. Swedish style flows into the rear where passengers
            will find good levels of head and leg room, although the middle occupant will have to contend with a sizeable
            transmission hump.

          <media:description>Volvo is aiming for all of its cars to feature some form of
            electrification by 2019 and so the new V60 has two gasoline plug-in hybrid options.
            The most potent T8 hybrid produces 385 horsewpoer. There’s also a range of conventional
            gasoline and diesel engines to accompany the plug-in cars.

            trunk and flat load bay. 529 liters of space makes it 99 liters bigger than the outgoing car, and actually more
            spacious than a BMW 3 Series Touring, Audi A4 Avant, and Mercedes-Benz C-Class Estate. Fold the rear seats flat to
            grant 1,364 liters of cargo space.

      <description>Mazda says the new Mazda6 is re-engineered, but looking at the company’s 2018 flagship sedan, it doesn’t seem much different than the outgoing model. It’s true that, at a glance, it’s the same attractive mid-sizer turning the front wheels, with stats that still match up to the outgoing model. That is, all stats save for the one labeled horsepower, provided you opt for the new SKYACTIV-G 2.5 T engine. In case you’re wondering, the T stands for turbo.

      <description>Buick has unveiled an online configurator for the 2018 Regal TourX wagon, and it shows that picking the full suite of premium options puts the sport wagon at $43,795. That prices it under its Regal GS Sportback sibling and competitors like the Volvo V60 Cross Country and Audi A4 Allroad.  The luxury hatchback starts at $29,995 and is available in three trim options: TourX 1SV, Preferred ($33,575) and Essence ($35,945). All are powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that puts out 250 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque and drives an eight-speed automatic transmission. Intelligent all-wheel-drive with active twin-clutch, start-stop technology and 18-inch painted aluminum wheels are also standard.

        <media:description>Buick has unveiled an online configurator for the 2018 Regal TourX wagon, and it shows that picking the full suite of premium options puts the sport wagon at $43,795. That prices it under its Regal GS Sportback sibling and competitors like the Volvo V60 Cross Country and Audi A4 Allroad. The luxury hatchback starts at $29,995 and is available in three trim options: TourX 1SV, Preferred ($33,575) and Essence ($35,945). All are powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that puts out 250 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque and drives an eight-speed automatic transmission. Intelligent all-wheel-drive with active twin-clutch, start-stop technology and 18-inch painted aluminum wheels are also standard.

      <title>2019 Mercedes-Benz CLS revives the straight six
      </title>
      <link>https://drivernews.us/2017/11/29/2019-mercedes-benz-cls-revives-the-straight-six/</link>

      <description>It's finally here, the third generation of the car that popularized the four-door coupe design, the Mercedes-Benz CLS. This 2019 model replaces the version that first appeared in production form way back in 2010. Compared with that car, the new CLS looks much cleaner and leaner. The look-at-me rear fender creases have vanished, the nose and tail straightened out, and the extra-wide grille and lights sit low in the front fascia. What remains is a high belt line and rakish roof. Overall, it might be a tad less distinctive, but more mature.
