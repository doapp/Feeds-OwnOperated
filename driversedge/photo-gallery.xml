        <media:description>It’s a looker isn’t it? Unlike dominant German rivals, the V60 ditches sharp creases in favor of
          flowing lines and generally more sculpted physique. Volvo’s signature Thor hammerhead headlights make a return on
          this wagon, as does a broad chromed grille. Overall the car presents a sophisticated and elegant alternative to SUV
          alternatives.

        <media:description>Inside you’ll find a cabin that won’t be mistaken for an Audi or BMW. A minimalist design
          comes curtesy of a large portrait touchscreen that has absorbed most of the switchgear. Air conditioning,
          navigation, media, it’s all housed in this 9.0-inch display. Swedish style flows into the rear where passengers
          will find good levels of head and leg room, although the middle occupant will have to contend with a sizeable
          transmission hump.

        <media:description>Volvo is aiming for all of its cars to feature some form of
          electrification by 2019 and so the new V60 has two gasoline plug-in hybrid options.
          The most potent T8 hybrid produces 385 horsewpoer. There’s also a range of conventional
          gasoline and diesel engines to accompany the plug-in cars.

        <media:description>Practicality is a high priority for any estate car and so this V60 is equipped with a large

          spacious than a BMW 3 Series Touring, Audi A4 Avant, and Mercedes-Benz C-Class Estate. Fold the rear seats flat to
          grant 1,364 liters of cargo space.

      <title>2018 Mazda6 Gets 250 HP Turbo Treatment, New Interior For LA Debut
      </title>
      <link>https://drivernews.us/2017/11/29/2018-mazda6-gets-250-hp-turbo-treatment-new-interior-for-la-debut/</link>
      <author>Christopher Smith
      </author>
      <description>Mazda says the new Mazda6 is re-engineered, but looking at the company’s 2018 flagship sedan, it doesn’t seem much different than the outgoing model. It’s true that, at a glance, it’s the same attractive mid-sizer turning the front wheels, with stats that still match up to the outgoing model. That is, all stats save for the one labeled horsepower, provided you opt for the new SKYACTIV-G 2.5 T engine. In case you’re wondering, the T stands for turbo.

      <description>Buick has unveiled an online configurator for the 2018 Regal TourX wagon, and it shows that picking the full suite of premium options puts the sport wagon at $43,795. That prices it under its Regal GS Sportback sibling and competitors like the Volvo V60 Cross Country and Audi A4 Allroad.  The luxury hatchback starts at $29,995 and is available in three trim options: TourX 1SV, Preferred ($33,575) and Essence ($35,945). All are powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that puts out 250 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque and drives an eight-speed automatic transmission. Intelligent all-wheel-drive with active twin-clutch, start-stop technology and 18-inch painted aluminum wheels are also standard.

      <title>2019 Mercedes-Benz CLS revives the straight six
      </title>

      <description>It's finally here, the third generation of the car that popularized the four-door coupe design, the Mercedes-Benz CLS. This 2019 model replaces the version that first appeared in production form way back in 2010. Compared with that car, the new CLS looks much cleaner and leaner. The look-at-me rear fender creases have vanished, the nose and tail straightened out, and the extra-wide grille and lights sit low in the front fascia. What remains is a high belt line and rakish roof. Overall, it might be a tad less distinctive, but more mature.
