      <title>2018 Mazda6 Gets 250 HP Turbo Treatment, New Interior For LA Debut
      </title>
      <link>https://drivernews.us/2017/11/29/2018-mazda6-gets-250-hp-turbo-treatment-new-interior-for-la-debut/</link>

      <description>Mazda says the new Mazda6 is re-engineered, but looking at the company’s 2018 flagship sedan, it doesn’t seem much different than the outgoing model. It’s true that, at a glance, it’s the same attractive mid-sizer turning the front wheels, with stats that still match up to the outgoing model. That is, all stats save for the one labeled horsepower, provided you opt for the new SKYACTIV-G 2.5 T engine. In case you’re wondering, the T stands for turbo.

      <description>Buick has unveiled an online configurator for the 2018 Regal TourX wagon, and it shows that picking the full suite of premium options puts the sport wagon at $43,795. That prices it under its Regal GS Sportback sibling and competitors like the Volvo V60 Cross Country and Audi A4 Allroad.

      <title>2019 Mercedes-Benz CLS revives the straight six
      </title>
      <link>https://drivernews.us/2017/11/29/2019-mercedes-benz-cls-revives-the-straight-six/</link>

      <description>It's finally here, the third generation of the car that popularized the four-door coupe design, the Mercedes-Benz CLS. This 2019 model replaces the version that first appeared in production form way back in 2010. Compared with that car, the new CLS looks much cleaner and leaner. The look-at-me rear fender creases have vanished, the nose and tail straightened out, and the extra-wide grille and lights sit low in the front fascia. What remains is a high belt line and rakish roof. Overall, it might be a tad less distinctive, but more mature.

        <media:description>The new CLS looks much cleaner and leaner. The look-at-me rear fender creases have vanished, the nose and tail straightened out, and the extra-wide grille and lights sit low in the front fascia. What remains is a high belt line and rakish roof. Overall, it might be a tad less distinctive, but more mature.
